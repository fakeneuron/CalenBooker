INITIAL PROMPT
I'm developing a web app according to the MVP.md file attached. The project has a backend and a frontend and supabase SQL scripts. Please take a look at the .md file and request the project files one at a time. Start with requesting all the backend files one at a time before moving on to the next sections (frontend, supabase). Confirm that you have all the needed files in each section before progressing to the next.

Post-File Updates
Let's start by cleaning up the backend. Once tested, we will move on to the cleanup sql scripts. . I'd like to highlight that i'm a novice coder and leaning to code by using AI while developing this app. Please proceed slowly and deliberately so that I can keep up. When possible, include the full code for files rather than just pieces for manual insert (however it is nice to know which code is being changed explicitly). Don't move too fast or provide too many updates at once. i rather deal with smaller pieces of information and update before proceeding to the next stage.

Specifics on the meeting invitation notification
Before moving on to the .ics generation, let's give some greater consideration to the purpose of this. Generation of the .ics is just a component of the whole 'meeting generation' notification that we will be giving clients. Clients are those seeking services from the businesses - the main goal of this app is to create not only a .ics but a standard meeting invitation message to the client. Let's make this live on a webpage for now - you've probably seen this kind of thing before - where you make an appointment and you receive either an email or a link containing different options such as 'add to icalendar', 'add to outlook' download .ics (am i missing any popular ones?). Give this some deeper thought to better capture this kind of message to be sent to clients after scheduling meetings with the businesses. The goal is for the business to enter client details in the meetings form and the client automatically gets a notification with all the easy integrations to their calendars. Provide a more detailed and standardized overview of what i'm describing here before proceeding. Provide a sample of this type of notification (email, web link) to the client as part of the plan with all the relevant buttons to add to calendar. Consider the logic of how this might be executed.

**Your Appointment with [Business Name]**
