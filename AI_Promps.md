**_INITIAL PROMPT_**
I’m working on a web app project described in the attached `README.md`, with a frontend, Supabase SQL scripts, and a backend placeholder. The project is live, and the coding environment is set. As a novice coder, I need step-by-step guidance to continue development.

Review the attached `README.md` and `Roadmap.md` to understand the project’s structure, technologies, and goals.

Request these core files: `frontend/src/App.jsx` and `frontend/src/supabaseClient.js`. Review them to understand their purpose without detailed feedback.

Later, as we tackle `Roadmap.md` Tasks, request additional files from me as needed. Project files and configurations are listed in `README.md`. If a relevant file is missing for a task, stop and request it before suggesting updates.

Be very cautious with Supabase changes to avoid breaking the authentication chain—it’s carefully configured.

Guide me step-by-step, ensuring I grasp coding, testing, and debugging. Explain concepts simply within our conversation. Encourage best practices (e.g., clean code, Git, standards, commenting).

After reviewing `README.md`, request `frontend/src/App.jsx`. Once all core files are collected, I’ll provide further context for next steps.

**_POST FILE UPLOADS_ ---MANUALLY UPDATED----**
I’ve shared the core project files with you. Review them to understand the app. Request additional files if needed for context.

Guide me through `Roadmap.md` Tasks, one at a time, ensuring I understand each step before proceeding. For file changes, show specific code additions, modifications, or removals, and provide the full updated file.

For `.sql` changes (e.g., via SQL Editor snippets), include the full updated file in the Supabase folder and a snippet to run in the SQL Editor, as the base `.sql` code is applied and tables shouldn’t be recreated. Be cautious with Supabase changes to avoid breaking the authentication chain—it’s carefully configured.

For each task:

- Create a `T###-ShortTitle.md` Task Note (e.g., `T001-OwnerCalendarSync.md`) to plan changes (minimal code, e.g., function names), track progress, and summarize updates, including the starting commit hash; skip for tasks under 1 hour and walk me through changes directly.
- Make a git commit (e.g., `git commit -m "Created T001-OwnerCalendarSync"`).
- Implement changes with me step-by-step, providing full updated files.
- Update `README.md`’s 'Project Structure and Functionality' with detailed changes and third-party configs for replication.
- Log accomplishments in `Roadmap.md`’s 'Progress (Completed)' section, referencing the Task ID (e.g., #001).
- Suggest Git commands (add, commit, push) after completion, with `README.md` and `Roadmap.md` updated first.

For `.md` updates, provide the full item (e.g., `#001`) with its number; for multiple sections, share the full file.

Keep explanations simple and concise for a novice coder. Start by listing `Roadmap.md` Tasks and ask which to tackle first.

**_SUPABASE-PROMPT_**
The Supabase database is set up. Request these `.sql` files for context: `create_tables.sql`, `rls.sql`, `check_email_exists.sql`. Be cautious with Supabase changes to avoid breaking the authentication chain—it’s carefully configured.
