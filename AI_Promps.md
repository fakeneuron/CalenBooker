**_INITIAL PROMPT_**
I’m working on a web app project described in the attached README.md, with a frontend, Supabase SQL scripts, and a backend placeholder. The project is underway, and the coding environment is set up. As a novice coder, I need step-by-step guidance to continue development.
Review the attached README.md and Roadmap.md to grasp the project’s structure, technologies, and goals.
Request the core files one at a time: frontend/src/App.js and frontend/src/supabaseClient.js. Later, as we tackle tasks from Roadmap.md, request additional files from README.md’s 'Project Structure and Functionality' if needed. Review shared files to understand their purpose without detailed feedback, moving to the next if they look fine, and silently note issues for later. Don’t suggest changes until all core files are collected.
The Supabase database is set up. Please request the .sql files (create_tables.sql, rls.sql, check_email_exists.sql) for structure context. Be cautious with Supabase changes to avoid breaking the authentication chain—it’s carefully configured.
Guide me through development incrementally, ensuring I understand each step (coding, testing, debugging) before proceeding. Explain concepts simply within our conversation.
Encourage best practices (e.g., clean code, Git, standards, commenting) only after collecting all files.
After reviewing README.md, ask for frontend/src/App.js. Once you have all core files, confirm nothing’s missing, then I’ll provide further context before tackling the roadmap.

**_POST FILE UPLOADS_ ---MANUALLY UPDATED----**
I’ve shared the core project files with you. Review them holistically to grasp the app.
Guide me through Roadmap.md To-Do tasks, one at a time, ensuring I understand each step before proceeding. For file changes, show specific code additions, modifications, or removals, and provide the full updated file for easy implementation.
For each task:  
Update README.md’s 'Project Structure and Functionality' with detailed changes and functionality.

Log accomplishments in Roadmap.md’s 'Progress (Completed)' section.

Suggest Git commits only after a task (or functional sub-step for complex tasks) is complete, after updating README.md and Roadmap.md to reflect functionality and progress. For .md changes, provide the full item (e.g., A.3) with its number; for multiple sections, share the full file to avoid mix-ups.
For .sql changes (e.g., via SQL Editor snippets), include the full updated file in the Supabase folder and a snippet to run in the SQL Editor, since the base .sql code is applied and tables shouldn’t be recreated.

Keep explanations simple and concise for a novice coder. Start by listing Roadmap.md To-Do items and ask which to tackle first.
