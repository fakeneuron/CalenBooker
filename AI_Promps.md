**_INITIAL PROMPT_**
I’m working on a web app project described in the attached `README.md`, with a frontend, Supabase SQL scripts, and a backend placeholder. The project is active, and the coding environment is ready. As a novice coder, I need step-by-step guidance to continue development.

Review the attached `README.md` and `Roadmap.md` to understand the project’s structure, technologies, and goals.

Request these core files one at a time: `frontend/src/App.js`, `frontend/src/supabaseClient.js`, `frontend/src/components/SignupForm.js`. Review them to grasp their purpose without detailed feedback, moving to the next if they’re fine, and silently note issues for later. Don’t suggest changes until all are collected.

Later, as we tackle `Roadmap.md` tasks, request additional files from `README.md`’s 'Project Structure and Functionality' or dependencies in `App.js` as needed. Always request files—don’t assume structure.

The Supabase database is set up. Request these `.sql` files for context: `create_tables.sql`, `rls.sql`, `check_email_exists.sql`. Be cautious with Supabase changes to avoid breaking the authentication chain—it’s carefully configured.

Guide me through development step-by-step, ensuring I understand coding, testing, and debugging. Explain concepts simply within our conversation. Encourage best practices (e.g., clean code, Git, standards, commenting).

After reviewing `README.md`, request `frontend/src/App.js`. Once all core and `.sql` files are collected, confirm nothing’s missing, then I’ll provide further context for next steps.

**_POST FILE UPLOADS_ ---MANUALLY UPDATED----**
I’ve shared the core project files with you. Review them to understand the app’s security, authentication, functionality, and styling. Request additional files if needed for context.

Guide me through `Roadmap.md` To-Do tasks, one at a time, ensuring I understand each step before proceeding. For file changes, show specific code additions, modifications, or removals, and provide the full updated file.

For `.sql` changes (e.g., via SQL Editor snippets), include the full updated file in the Supabase folder and a snippet to run in the SQL Editor, as the base `.sql` code is applied and tables shouldn’t be recreated.

For each task:

- Update `README.md`’s 'Project Structure and Functionality' with detailed changes and functionality for replication.
- Log accomplishments in `Roadmap.md`’s 'Progress (Completed)' section.
- Suggest Git commands (add, commit, push) only after a full task is complete, with `README.md` and `Roadmap.md` updated first, unless I prompt otherwise.

For `.md` updates, provide the full item (e.g., A.3) with its number; for multiple sections, share the full file. Follow this per task:

- Plan the code changes.
- Implement changes with me step-by-step, providing full updated files.
- Update `README.md` functionality or setup (full file or section).
- Log progress in `Roadmap.md` (full file or section); add new tasks if needed.
- Provide Git commands (add, commit, push).

Keep explanations simple and concise for a novice coder. Start by listing `Roadmap.md` To-Do items and ask which to tackle first.
