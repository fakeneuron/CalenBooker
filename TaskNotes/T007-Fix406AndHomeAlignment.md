## Task: Fix 406 Error and Home Page Button Alignment

- **Goal**: Resolve the 406 error on `/appt-confirm/:id` and center the "Login" and "Get Started" buttons on the home page.
- **Details**: Update `useAppointmentDetails.jsx` to handle `appointment_links` fetch failures gracefully and ensure a short link is always available; adjust `styles.js` and `Home.jsx` to center buttons in `Home.jsx`. Verify Supabase data and permissions as needed.
- **Effort**: ~1-2 hours (actual: ~3 hours due to iterative fixes)
- **Steps**:
  1. Investigate 406 error source in `useAppointmentDetails.jsx` (likely `appointment_links` query).
  2. Update `useAppointmentDetails.jsx` to create a short link if none exists, avoiding 406 crashes.
  3. Modify `styles.js` to center `buttonGroup` buttons on all screen sizes.
  4. Test `/appt-confirm/7` and home page (`/`) locally.
  5. Update imports in affected files if applicable.
  6. Test locally to ensure no breaks (e.g., run `npm start`, check key pages like `/dashboard`, `/appt-scheduler`).
  7. Update `README.md` with any changes to filenames, routes, functionality, configuration, or project structure as applicable.
- **Progress**:
  - [x] Identify files
  - [x] Fix 406 error handling
  - [x] Center home page buttons
  - [x] Update imports (not needed)
  - [x] Test locally
  - [x] Update `README.md` (no changes needed)
- **File Tracking**:
  - **In Memory**: Files already provided to the assistant.
  - **Modified**: Files changed during the task.
  - **Files**:
    - [In Memory] frontend/src/App.jsx - [Routing]
    - [In Memory] frontend/src/supabaseClient.js - [Supabase setup]
    - [In Memory] frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx - [Home page]
    - [Modified] frontend/src/styles.js - [Updated buttonGroup for centering]
    - [Modified] frontend/src/hooks/useAppointmentDetails.jsx - [Improved 406 handling with maybeSingle and isolated insert]
    - [Modified] frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx - [Added items-center to buttonGroup]
- **Notes**: 406 error due to missing `appointment_links` row or RLS on insert; reduced to warning; home page fix required build step to take effect; no functionality changes to document in README.
- **Challenges**:
  - Persistent 406 error on `/appt-confirm/7` reduced from two to one with `.maybeSingle()`; final error from `insert` moved to warning, but still logs as 406; added to Roadmap for full fix.
  - Home page buttons aligned left until build/preview applied changes; caching/build step was critical.
- **Summary**: Fixed home page button alignment by updating `styles.js` and `Home.jsx` with centering styles, confirmed with build/preview. Reduced 406 errors on `/appt-confirm/7` from two to one by using `.maybeSingle()`, then moved `insert` error to a warning, minimizing console impact. Page loads correctly; remaining 406 moved to a new Roadmap task for Supabase RLS/data resolution.
