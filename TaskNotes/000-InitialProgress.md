# Task Note 000 - Initial Progress

This document captures the initial completed progress for CalenBooker up to March 22, 2025, migrated from `Roadmap.md` to establish the task tracking process.

## Completed Tasks

- **Initial Setup** (Completed: Pre-March 20, 2025)

  - Established core project structure: Git repo (`github.com/fakeneuron/CalenBooker`), React frontend with Tailwind CSS, Supabase backend, minimal Express backend, and Netlify HTTPS deployment.
  - Documented in `README.md` under "Project Setup" and "Deployment".

- **Frontend Enhancements** (Completed: Pre-March 20, 2025)

  - Improved UI/UX with inline login/signup (`Home.jsx`), autologin post-confirmation (`AuthConfirm.jsx`), enhanced scheduler (`AppointmentScheduler.jsx`), static pages (`Terms.jsx`, `Privacy.jsx`, etc.), and refined navigation (`Navbar.jsx`, `Footer.jsx`) with Kawaii styling (pastels, rounded shapes).
  - Noted in `README.md` under "Frontend Overview > Pages" and "Components".

- **Database and Security** (Completed: Pre-March 20, 2025)

  - Set up Supabase tables (`business_profile`, `appointments`, `messages`, `appointment_links`) with RLS policies (`rls.sql`, `public.sql`) and secure email checks (`check_email_exists.sql`).
  - Hardened security by dropping `users_view` (#011), setting OTP expiry (3600s), and adding password checks in `SignupForm.jsx`.
  - Updated `README.md` under "Database Setup" and "Third-Party Configurations > Supabase".

- **Appointment System** (Completed: Pre-March 20, 2025)

  - Built client-facing features: scheduling (`AppointmentScheduler.jsx`), notifications with calendar integration (`.ics`, Google, Outlook in confirmation pages), and customizable messages (`Messages.jsx`).
  - Integrated into `README.md` under "Current Features".

- **Authentication Fixes** (Completed: Pre-March 20, 2025)

  - Enhanced auth reliability with terms checkbox (`SignupForm.jsx`), reCAPTCHA v2 integration, and consistent redirects (`VITE_AUTH_REDIRECT` in `SignupForm.jsx`, `LoginForm.jsx`).
  - Noted in `README.md` under "Project Setup > Frontend" and "Current Features".

- **#006 - Email-Friendly Message Format** (Completed: March 20, 2025)

  - Effort: ~2-3 hours
  - Documented in `README.md` under "Current Features > Appointment Confirmation with Short Links".

- **#008 - Fix Confirmation Resend Token Reuse** (Completed: March 20, 2025)

  - Updated `SignupForm.jsx` and `LoginForm.jsx` to use `emailRedirectTo` from `VITE_AUTH_REDIRECT`, fixing resend link mismatches (e.g., `localhost:4000/auth/confirm` locally, `delparte.com/auth/confirm` live).
  - Effort: ~2-3 hours
  - Added to `README.md` under "Project Setup > Frontend" and "Known Issues" resolution.

- **#009 - Messages Section** (Completed: March 20, 2025)

  - Implemented `Messages.jsx` for customizable messages (`scheduled`, `rescheduled`, `cancelled`, `no_show`) in `messages` table, moved business info fields to `business_profile`, initialized on `Dashboard.jsx`.
  - Effort: ~4-6 hours
  - Updated `README.md` under "Pages", "Database Setup", and "Current Features".

- **#011 - Secure `users_view` Access** (Completed: March 20, 2025)

  - Dropped `users_view`, implemented `check_email_exists` with `SECURITY DEFINER`, restricted to `anon` execution, verified signup post-reset.
  - Effort: ~2-4 hours
  - Reflected in `README.md` under "Database Setup > Functions" and "Third-Party Configurations > Supabase".

- **Migrate from CRA to Vite** (Completed: March 19-20, 2025)

  - Migrated frontend to Vite (`vite@6.2.2`, `@vitejs/plugin-react@4.3.4`), renamed `.js` to `.jsx`, moved `index.html`, added `postcss.config.js`, updated env vars to `VITE_*`, removed CRA leftovers, fixed Netlify deployment.
  - Effort: ~10-12 hours
  - Updated `README.md` under "Technical Approach", "Project Setup", and "Deployment".

- **Appointment Confirmation Enhancements** (Completed: March 20, 2025)

  - Split `AppointmentConfirmation.jsx` into `AppointmentConfirmationPrivate.jsx` and `AppointmentConfirmationPublic.jsx`, added `appointment_links` table with short links, enhanced `AppointmentsTable.jsx` with copy icons.
  - Effort: ~6-8 hours
  - Documented in `README.md` under "Pages", "Components", "Database Setup", and "Current Features".

- **Comprehensive README Update** (Completed: March 22, 2025)
