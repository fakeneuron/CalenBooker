# Task Note 000 - Initial Progress

This document captures the initial completed progress for CalenBooker up to March 22, 2025, migrated from `Roadmap.md` as the first historical log.

## Completed Milestones

### Initial Setup

- **Plan**: Establish core project structure with Git repo, React frontend, Supabase backend, and Netlify deployment.
- **Progress**: Set up `github.com/fakeneuron/CalenBooker`, built React frontend with Tailwind CSS, integrated Supabase tables (`business_profile`, `appointments`), deployed to `https://delparte.com`.
- **Challenges**: Initial Netlify config required HTTPS adjustments; Supabase RLS setup needed iterative testing.
- **Outcome**: Functional MVP structure with Git, frontend, backend, and HTTPS deployment, documented in `README.md` "Project Setup" and "Deployment".

### Frontend Enhancements

- **Plan**: Enhance UI/UX with inline login/signup, scheduler improvements, static pages, and Kawaii styling.
- **Progress**: Implemented `Home.jsx` with toggles, autologin in `AuthConfirm.jsx`, static pages (`Terms.jsx`, etc.), and navigation (`Navbar.jsx`, `Footer.jsx`) with pastel/rounded styling.
- **Challenges**: Balancing Kawaii aesthetics with usability; ensuring mobile responsiveness.
- **Outcome**: Improved user experience, reflected in `README.md` "Frontend Overview > Pages" and "Components".

### Database and Security

- **Plan**: Set up Supabase tables, secure auth, and harden data access.
- **Progress**: Created tables (`business_profile`, `appointments`, `messages`, `appointment_links`), added RLS (`rls.sql`, `public.sql`), secured email checks (`check_email_exists.sql`), dropped `users_view` (#011).
- **Challenges**: `users_view` exposure required rework; RLS initially blocked message initialization at signup.
- **Outcome**: Secure database with RLS, updated in `README.md` "Database Setup" and "Third-Party Configurations > Supabase".

### Appointment System

- **Plan**: Build scheduling, notifications, and message customization features.
- **Progress**: Developed `AppointmentScheduler.jsx` for booking, calendar integration (`.ics`, Google, Outlook) in confirmation pages, and `Messages.jsx` for event messages.
- **Challenges**: Coordinating message display across pages; ensuring calendar compatibility.
- **Outcome**: Client-facing appointment system, noted in `README.md` "Current Features".

### Authentication Fixes

- **Plan**: Improve auth flow reliability with redirects, terms, and reCAPTCHA.
- **Progress**: Added terms checkbox and reCAPTCHA v2 in `SignupForm.jsx`, fixed resend redirects (#008) using `VITE_AUTH_REDIRECT`.
- **Challenges**: Resend link mismatches between local and live environments; reCAPTCHA integration required env var tweaks.
- **Outcome**: Reliable auth flow, updated in `README.md` "Project Setup > Frontend".

### Email-Friendly Message Format

- **Plan**: Add formatted messages for email/SMS in confirmation pages.
- **Progress**: Implemented in `AppointmentConfirmationPrivate.jsx` with short links (`/a/<short_code>`), SMS/email formats, and `.ics` integration (from #006).
- **Challenges**: Formatting for cross-client compatibility; ensuring short links were clickable.
- **Outcome**: Enhanced communication options, documented in `README.md` "Current Features > Appointment Confirmation".

### Fix Confirmation Resend Token Reuse

- **Plan**: Fix resend link redirect issues (from #008).
- **Progress**: Updated `SignupForm.jsx` and `LoginForm.jsx` to use `emailRedirectTo` from `VITE_AUTH_REDIRECT`, tested locally and live.
- **Challenges**: Expired token reuse required Supabase auth tweak; env var consistency needed.
- **Outcome**: Consistent redirects, added to `README.md` "Project Setup > Frontend".

### Messages Section

- **Plan**: Add customizable messages and move business info (from #009).
- **Progress**: Built `Messages.jsx` with edit/revert for `messages` table, shifted `parking_instructions` etc. to `business_profile`, initialized on `Dashboard.jsx`.
- **Challenges**: RLS blocked signup initialization; UI layout initially cluttered.
- **Outcome**: Flexible message system, updated in `README.md` "Pages" and "Database Setup".

### Secure `users_view` Access

- **Plan**: Harden Supabase security by removing `users_view` (from #011).
- **Progress**: Dropped `users_view`, implemented `check_email_exists` with `SECURITY DEFINER`, tested signup.
- **Challenges**: Persistent security warnings; required DB reset to verify.
- **Outcome**: Secure email checks, noted in `README.md` "Database Setup > Functions".

### Resolve npm Vulnerabilities

- **Plan**: Eliminate npm vulnerabilities post-migration (from #014).
- **Progress**: Ran `npm audit`, confirmed zero vulnerabilities after Vite update.
- **Challenges**: Pre-migration vulnerabilities (11, including 7 high) required dependency updates.
- **Outcome**: Clean dependency tree, updated in `README.md` "Dependencies".

### Migrate from CRA to Vite

- **Plan**: Migrate frontend to Vite for performance.
- **Progress**: Replaced `react-scripts` with `vite@6.2.2`, renamed files to `.jsx`, updated env vars to `VITE_*`, fixed Netlify deployment (March 19-20, 2025).
- **Challenges**: File renaming broke imports; Netlify required `dist/` adjustment.
- **Outcome**: Faster builds/dev server, documented in `README.md` "Technical Approach" and "Deployment".

### Appointment Confirmation Enhancements

- **Plan**: Split confirmation views and enhance table.
- **Progress**: Refactored `AppointmentConfirmation.jsx` into `Private` and `Public` versions, added `appointment_links` table, enhanced `AppointmentsTable.jsx` with copy icons (March 20, 2025).
- **Challenges**: Routing consistency; overlay feedback styling.
- **Outcome**: Improved usability/sharing, updated in `README.md` "Pages", "Components", and "Current Features".

### Comprehensive README Update

- **Plan**: Expand `README.md` with full project details.
- **Progress**: Added file structure, third-party configs, known issues, and setup clarifications (March 22, 2025, via this thread).
- **Challenges**: Balancing detail with readability; ensuring all changes captured.
- **Outcome**: Comprehensive guide, reflected across `README.md`.
