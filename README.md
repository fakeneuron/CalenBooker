# Task Note - Appointment Confirmation Enhancement

This document outlines the steps to enhance the appointment confirmation page with short links and calendar integration, plus a refactoring plan. Last updated: March 22, 2025.

## Plan

### Create appointment_links Table in Supabase

- **File**: `supabase/create_tables.sql`
- **Details**: Add `appointment_links` table to store short codes for appointments.
- **Fields**:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `short_code` (text, unique)
  - `appointment_id` (BIGINT, foreign key to `appointments(id)`)
  - `expires_at` (timestamptz)
  - `created_at` (timestamptz, default NOW())
- **Status**: [x] Completed

### Set Up RLS for appointment_links

- **File**: `supabase/rls.sql`
- **Details**: Enable RLS on `appointment_links`. Policies: authenticated users insert/select their own links; public read access to non-expired links.
- **Status**: [x] Completed

### Create Utility for Short Code Generation

- **File**: `frontend/src/utils/shortCode.js`
- **Details**: Create `generateShortCode` using `nanoid` to generate unique 8-character codes, checking uniqueness against `appointment_links`.
- **Status**: [x] Completed

### Update App.jsx to Add Public Route

- **File**: `frontend/src/App.jsx`
- **Details**: Add route `/a/:code` to render `AppointmentConfirmationPublic.jsx` for public access via short link. Update `/appointment-confirmation/:id` to use `AppointmentConfirmationPrivate.jsx`.
- **Status**: [x] Completed

### Update AppointmentConfirmation.jsx

- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/AppointmentConfirmation.jsx`
- **Details**: Initially handle both `/appointment-confirmation/:id` (private) and `/a/:code` (public) routes. Fetch appointment ID from `appointment_links` for public route, generate/store short link (private only) with expiration (appointment date + 1 day), update email/SMS formats with short link, add `.ics` link to email format. Later refactor into separate files (see Refactor section).
- **Status**: [x] Completed (pre-refactor)

### Test

- **Steps**:
  - Update `supabase/create_tables.sql` and `supabase/rls.sql` (done).
  - Run SQL in Supabase (done).
  - Update `App.jsx`, `AppointmentConfirmationPrivate.jsx`, `AppointmentConfirmationPublic.jsx`, `AppointmentsTable.jsx` (done).
  - Test locally:
    - `cd /Users/fakeneuron/Code/Calenbooker/frontend`
    - `npm run build`
    - `npm run preview`
  - **Private Route**: Visit `http://localhost:4173/appointment-confirmation/<id>`:
    - Email/SMS formats include clickable short link (`localhost:4173/a/<short_code>`), `.ics` download works.
  - **Public Route**: Visit `http://localhost:4173/a/<short_code>`—matches private details, simplified view.
  - **Expiration**: Set `expires_at` in past, access short link—shows "This link has expired".
  - **Copy**: Paste email/SMS into Gmail/SMS app, verify links/`.ics` work.
- **Status**: [x] Completed
- **Notes**: Local testing verified short links, expiration, and copy functionality (e.g., `localhost:4173/a/F6XfLdxw`). All features operational as of March 20, 2025.

### Deploy to Live Site

- **Details**: Deploy updated code to `delparte.com`. Sync Supabase production DB with `appointment_links` table and RLS. Verify short links live (e.g., `https://delparte.com/a/<short_code>`).
- **Status**: [ ] Not Started
- **Notes**: Pending Netlify redeploy and Supabase production sync.

### Refactor AppointmentConfirmation.jsx

- **Details**: At 358 lines, `AppointmentConfirmation.jsx` was large. Refactor for reusability and clarity:
  - **Extract Data Fetching**: Move `fetchAppointmentDetails` to `useAppointmentDetails.js` (custom hook).
  - **Extract Formatting**: Move email/SMS formatting and `.ics` generation to `appointmentUtils.js`.
  - **Split UI**:
    - `AppointmentConfirmationPrivate.jsx`: Full view with SMS/email for business owners (private route).
    - `AppointmentConfirmationPublic.jsx`: Simplified view with only web details for clients (public route, no SMS/email).
    - Delete `AppointmentConfirmation.jsx`, replace with direct routing in `App.jsx`.
  - **Update App.jsx**: Update routes to use `AppointmentConfirmationPrivate.jsx` for `/appointment-confirmation/:id` and `AppointmentConfirmationPublic.jsx` for `/a/:code`.
  - **Enhance AppointmentsTable.jsx**: Add web/email/SMS copy links per row with overlay feedback using `appointmentUtils.js` and `react-icons`.
- **Status**: [x] Completed
- **Effort**: ~6-8 hours
- **Priority**: Medium - Improves maintainability and reusability.

## Progress

- Implemented `appointment_links` table and RLS policies in Supabase (March 18, 2025).
- Built short code generation utility and tested uniqueness (March 18, 2025).
- Updated routing in `App.jsx` and initial confirmation logic in `AppointmentConfirmation.jsx` (March 19, 2025).
- Conducted local testing, confirming all features worked as expected (March 20, 2025).
- Refactored `AppointmentConfirmation.jsx` into separate components, extracted logic to hooks/utils, and enhanced table (March 20, 2025).

## Challenges

- Ensuring short code uniqueness required iterative DB checks in `shortCode.js`.
- Initial RLS setup allowed expired links briefly; fixed with stricter `public.sql` policy.
- Refactoring required re-testing all routes to avoid regressions.
- Overlay feedback in `AppointmentsTable.jsx` needed CSS tweaks via `styles.js` for visibility.

## Summary of Implementations

- **Completed**: March 20, 2025
- **Outcome**: Enhanced appointment confirmation with short links (`/a/<short_code>`) and calendar integration (`.ics`, Google, Outlook). Refactored `AppointmentConfirmation.jsx` (deleted) into `AppointmentConfirmationPrivate.jsx` (private, full view) and `AppointmentConfirmationPublic.jsx` (public, simplified view). Added `appointment_links` table with RLS, short code generation in `shortCode.js`, and copy functionality in `AppointmentsTable.jsx`. Local testing verified all features (short links, expiration, `.ics` downloads). Deployment to `delparte.com` pending.
- **Files Updated**: `supabase/create_tables.sql`, `supabase/rls.sql`, `frontend/src/App.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/AppointmentConfirmationPrivate.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/AppointmentConfirmationPublic.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/AppointmentsTable.jsx`, `frontend/src/utils/shortCode.js`, `frontend/src/hooks/useAppointmentDetails.js`, `frontend/src/utils/appointmentUtils.js`, `frontend/src/styles.js`.
- **Files Removed**: `frontend/src/pages/AppointmentConfirmation.jsx` (deprecated, deleted March 22, 2025).
- **Notes**: Functionality fully implemented and tested locally; live deployment remains as a separate step. "Appt" rename deferred to a future task.
